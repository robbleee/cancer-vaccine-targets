Overall Review of Prioritization Results
This analysis provides a snapshot of genes highly upregulated in the cancer samples compared to normal samples within your dataset. Here's an assessment of the list as a whole:
1. Replication of Known Biology:
Strong Confirmation: The list successfully identifies several genes/proteins already well-documented as being overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and often associated with its progression. Examples include:
Secreted/Membrane Proteins: NOTUM, CXCL5, CLDN2, KLK6 (mis-annotated location), REG3A, REG1A, DEFA5/DEFA6 (mis-annotated location), MMP7, ESM1. These represent known pathways involved in Wnt signaling, inflammation, cell adhesion, tissue remodeling, and innate immunity â€“ all relevant to CRC.
Intracellular Proteins: The identification of highly upregulated transcription factors like FOXQ1 and ETV4 (both mis-annotated locations) also aligns with known CRC biology, as these drive oncogenic gene expression programs. Keratin KRT23 upregulation is also seen in CRC.
Conclusion: Yes, to a significant degree, your analysis using this dataset and tool replicates known findings by highlighting genes established as upregulated in CRC. This provides confidence that the underlying differential expression analysis is capturing relevant biological signals.
2. Potential for Novel Targets:
Promising Candidates: Beyond the well-known players, the list contains several membrane or secreted proteins with high fold changes and statistical significance that might represent less commonly discussed or potentially novel targets specifically for immunotherapy/vaccine development in CRC. Examples based on verified locations include:
SEMA4B (Membrane)
IGFL4 (Secreted)
DPEP1 (Membrane)
CEL (Secreted)
SLC22A11 (Membrane)
LY6G6D (Membrane)
FAM132A (Secreted)
Caveats: "Novelty" here means potentially less explored as vaccine targets. These genes might still be well-studied in other contexts of CRC biology. Further literature review on each specific candidate's function, expression pattern across normal tissues (for safety), and existing therapeutic targeting efforts would be essential.
Conclusion: Yes, the list presents several interesting candidates that fit the desired profile (accessible location, high upregulation) and may warrant deeper investigation as potentially novel immunotherapy targets.
3. Overall Quality and Considerations:
Non-Coding RNAs: A significant number of highly ranked hits (ENSG00000214039, ENSG00000249550, ENSG00000249306, ENSG00000251095, ENSG00000276122, ENSG00000228742, ENSG00000281406 - some IDs might need re-verification) appear to be LINC RNAs or other non-coding transcripts based on their gene IDs. While their upregulation is biologically relevant to CRC, they are not protein targets and need to be filtered out for your specific goal.
Annotation Accuracy: As seen previously, the cellular_location column provided in your results file has inaccuracies (e.g., KLK6, ETV4, FOXQ1, DEFA5/6 listed with incorrect locations). This means external verification of the location for every candidate of interest is mandatory before considering it further as a vaccine target. Relying solely on the list's annotations would lead to errors.
Statistical Significance: While fold changes are often very high, some p-values are closer to the significance threshold (e.g., in the 0.01-0.03 range). Depending on the rigor required, you might apply a stricter p-value cutoff.
In Summary:
Your prioritization run appears successful in identifying a pool of significantly upregulated genes in your CRC dataset. It validates known biology by including established CRC-associated genes and also presents a set of potentially novel, accessible protein targets (like NOTUM, CLDN2, REG3A, SEMA4B, DPEP1 etc.) worthy of further exploration for vaccine development. However, the list requires careful curation to remove non-coding RNAs and, most importantly, independent verification of the cellular location for each protein candidate due to demonstrated inaccuracies in the source annotation data.
